# Project Proposal

Project Topic: Analyzing the Morris Worm and Making Our Own

Partners: Aadi, Lazuli, Liam
Fun Name: GLØWŸRM
Project Description:
In depth research on the Morris Worm with our own implementation of a worm.  We shall show how a hole in the security of a machine can be exploited to spread a worm. We plan to implement this on a network of VMs using default SSH credentials.
Deliverables

- Brief presentation on what worms are and how they can be used to attack computers.
- Demonstration of our worm infecting a network of VMs using default SSH credentials.
- BACKUP PLAN: Demonstration of how a worm could be used to exploit a vulnerability if spreading over SSH doesn’t work.

## Presentation and Demo:

[Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b2hTUDB1Crdh1Jjt8I0f-XgCROYWPmdgbozV3W2xhNA/edit?usp=sharing) is the link to our presentation it provides a brief outline of the Morris Worm, its functionality, and its impact as well as a demo of our own worm infecting a cluster of VMs.
