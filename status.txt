I was able to download Kali on my windows pc no problem, so I at least have a machine capable of running
a VM. Unfortunately, my laptop which runs linux could not (despite my sincere efforts) properly install
VMWare. My current understanding is VMWare or whatever company owns them now is not up to date with the
current linux kernel, so I am unable to compile pieces of software correctly. However, I did set up a
dual boot just in case I want to use Kali on my laptop, but that does not have the added layer of security
between my actual computer and the os that the VM would.
